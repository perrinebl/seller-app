## Folder Structure

We tend to use the Atomic Design approach while writing our components:

```
/src
    /ds
        /atoms
        /molecules
        /templates
        /pages
```

# Testing

We will tend to use anytime/anywhere our custom `render` method to represent the technical context of our application.

This `render` method is defined in `/src/test.utils.js`.
